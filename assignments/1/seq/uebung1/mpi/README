Do once a session "module load openmpi/gnu"


A template directory for your MPI program in assignment 1.

Name your source file ring.c and call "make" to compile your program.

Change inside the job script "job_mpi.sh" the number of nodes (1 <= nodes <= 10).
Don't change ppn=16. The number of processors used is the (#nodes * 16).

Then run your program with the batch script "qsub job_mpi.sh".
