If you start the program with "make run" the program reads a graph
file. The graph data structure needs 64 GB.

Please be aware that wr5 has only 128 GB.

Conclusions: you cannot allocate any amount of memory you want. If you
need additional data structures please (as always) think about what
you need and what you don't need.
