This directory contains subdirectories with sources for trace
generation for a command, and cache simulations based upon these
traces.  Each subdirectory contains one application program and
everything else you need for such a simulation. In your subdirectory
you must compile your program with "make" before ou start simulations.

There are two python scripts in this directory that may help you:

1) mkjobs.py

This script generates all job submission commands necessary for a
bunch of cache simulations. You must specify in a call to mkjobs.py:
- starting port (the script assigns from that port sucessive jobs successive ports)
- the executable you want to generate a trace for
- program arguments to the executable
Example:
prompt> mkjobs.py 11000 bubblesort.exe 30000 50000 80000 > runjobs.sh

Run the mkjobs.py script in your subdirectory. The generated submission calls
(in the generated script runjobs.sh) can then be submitted to the batch system with:

prompt> sh runjobs.sh

Be aware that a lot of jobs get started (approx. 200)!


2) evaluation.py

Start this script in the generated output directory. This script goes
through all generated simulation result files, applies the cost model,
and produces in a csv-file the result (spent cycles in the simulated
program with the specific cache parameters). Call this script with the
program size arguments you specified in the mkjobs.py script.
Example:

prompt> python evaluation.py 10000 30000 80000
