Program arguments
=================
submit a program argument as one number: kernelnumber_datasetselection

where "kernelnumber" is your assigned kernel number and data set
selection chooses one out of three possible data sets (see below). You
must specify these two numbers to the program as one number with
format "xy" where x is the kernel number (from 1-24) and y is the data
set number (from 1-3).  Example: you kernel number is 15. Then you
must run the program three times with program arguments 151, 152, 153,
respectively (i.e. "mkjobs.py your_port kernel.exe 151 152 153").


Your kernel:
============
Inside kernel.f your find the code that gets executed for your kernel
if you search for "subroutine kernelx" inside the file.

All kernels are executed 10 times.

You must compile the source file with "make". This generates the
executable file "kernel.exe" that produces the memory acesses. Ignore
any compiler warnings during compilation.




Each number after the kernel number in the command line call selects a parameter set for data sizes:

Parameter settings for ndim1 (all kernels other than kernel 4,6,21):
1) ndim1=1024*32
2) ndim1=1024*256
3) ndim1=4*1000*1000

Parameter settings for ndim1 (kernel 4):
1) ndim1=1024*32
2) ndim1=1024*128
3) ndim1=1024*512

Parameter settings for ndim2 (kernel 6):
1) ndim2=128
2) ndim2=512
3) ndim2=1000

Parameter settings for ndim1 (kernel 21):
1) ndim1=1024*32
2) ndim1=1024*64
3) ndim1=1024*128



Run times:
==========
approx. time for largest configuration:
all kernels other than given below: < 60 minutes
kernel 8,13,14,23: <4 hours
kernel 4,15,18,21: < 12 hours
